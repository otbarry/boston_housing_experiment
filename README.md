## **Background**
This experiment investigates the effect of price salience on renting behavior and perceived fairness in Boston's housing market. It is grounded in behavioral economics, particularly prospect theory, which suggests that individuals are more sensitive to losses than gains. Price salience aids potential renters in making informed decisions by providing clear information about property costs, facilitating comparisons and evaluations of affordability. Additionally, it promotes market efficiency by reducing search costs and enhancing competition, ultimately benefiting both consumers and market participants. Our research question is: How does price salience affect consumers' willingness to rent a property and their perceived fairness of the price?
## **Methodology**
- Sampling Method: Simple random sampling
- Target Population: US residents (due to use of USD for rent prices)
- Survey Platform: Qualtrics
- Utilized built-in feature for random assignment to control and treatment groups
- Control Group: Shown all-inclusive price
- Treatment Group: Shown price inclusive of additional fees (broker fees, monthly expenses as percentage)
- Main questions for each apartment:Likelihood of signing a lease, Perception of pricing (underpriced, overpriced, or fair), Suggested fair price if not perceived as fair
## **Key Insights**
**Average Treatment Effects (ATE)**:
- Likelihood of Leasing: ATE of -0.12 indicates that less salient prices make individuals less likely to rent.
- Price Perception: ATE of 0.05 suggests that less salient prices may lead to perceptions of being overpriced.
- Price Suggestion: ATE of -54 indicates participants suggested a price $54 lower when encountering less salient prices.

**Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE)**:
- Men showed a greater sensitivity to less salient prices (-0.31) compared to women (0.08).
- Boston residents were less likely to rent with less salient prices (-0.24), while those outside Boston were more likely (0.08).
- Unemployed respondents had a negative ATE of -0.18, while employed respondents had a positive ATE of 0.16.
  
**Statistical Power**: 
- The study lacked sufficient statistical power due to a small sample size (79 participants), necessitating a larger sample (892-1438) for more robust conclusions.
  
**Regression Analysis**: 
- Consistently negative treatment effects across OLS and fixed effects regressions indicate that price salience did not significantly influence leasing decisions.
